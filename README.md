# The Creator of Man

<strong>The Beginning Created</strong><br/>
<i>Gen1:1</i><br/><br/>

Before time there was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br/><br/>

In the beginning (time), God created the heavens (space) and the earth (matter). <br/>
God put everything in order so that it might become His dwelling place,<br/>
the place of His presence, displaying His glory.<br/><br/>

Thus, “in the beginning” refers to the beginning of everything.<br/> 
God created everything in the universe,<br/> 
which means that He created it out of nothing.<br/><br/>

Everything that was created was created by the Word of God.<br/>
God’s absolute power is seen in that He merely speaks,<br/>
and things are created.<br/><br/>

By the power of the Word of God, all of space, all of time,<br/>
all of matter in the universe were created.

<b>The Man Created</b><br/>
<i>Gen1:26, Gen 1:27</i><br/><br/>

Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”.<br/>
Many Christians believe that “let us” means God speaking to Himself.<br/>
If so, this would be the first biblical mention of the “Trinity”.<br/><br/>

Human beings are not made in the image of angels (sons of God),<br/>
and there is no mention of angels participating in the creation of man.<br/><br/>

The Hebrew word for man (‘adam), is a generic term for both male and female.<br/><br/>

So God created man in His own image, in the image of God he created him;<br/>
male and female he created them.
